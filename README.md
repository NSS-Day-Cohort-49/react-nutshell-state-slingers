# Social Buzz

## Setup: Follow these steps exactly

1. Use terminal to clone this repository
1. `cd` into the directory it creates
```
git clone git@github.com:NSS-Day-Cohort-49/react-nutshell-state-slingers.git
cd react-nutshell-state-slingers
```
1. Create an `api` directory outside of the project directory.
1. In the `api` directory, create a copy of the `database.json.example` and remove the `.example` extension.
1. Run `json-server -p 8088 -w database.json` from the `api` directory.
1. Run `npm install` and wait for all dependencies to be installed.
1. Run `npm start` to verify that installation was successful.

> **Note:** Your `database.json` file is already in the `.gitignore` file for this project, so it will never be added to the repo or pushed to Github.
